# A Conflict Resolution Framework for PouchDB
A JavaScript framework working on top of PouchDB, aimed at simplifying the development of conflict resolution mechanisms.

This framework was developed as an artifact for a B.Sc. IT (Hons) Software Development thesis at the University of Malta under the supervision of Dr. Joshua Ellul and Dr. Joseph Vella. 
I would really appreciate it if you, as PouchDB users and developers could try out the framework and let me know what you think
