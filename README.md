# A Conflict Resultion Framework for PouchDB
A JavaScript framework working on top of PouchDB, aimed at simplifying the development of conflict resolution mechanisms.

This framework was developed as an artifact for a B.Sc. IT (Hons) Software Development thesis at the University of Malta. 
I would really appreciate it if you, as PouchDB users and developers could try out the framework and let me know what you think 
using the survey below:
